# DirectedGraphDemo

This is an application that demonstrates searching for a path between two nodes in a directed graph. If at least one
path is found, it is printed. 

This development problem will deal with finding a path from one node to another in a 
non-weighted, directional graph. There are no restrictions on usage of standard Java 
packages. 

Create a Java application that takes a single file name, and two node ID strings as 
parameters (&lt;filename> &lt;node1> &lt;node2>). The file will consist graph edge data,
one edge per line. If a line that contains "AA DD" describes an edge that connects
node AA to node DD, in that direction only. Create the necessary data structures 
to store an arbitrarily sized graph, then determine whether it is possible reach 
reach node1 from node2. If it is possible to complete that traversal, then print out
the path as a series of node IDs, otherwise print out a notification that the two 
nodes are not connected.

An earlier version of this exercise used the JgraphT library. Some of the ideas have been 
retained. 

The source code, and supporting IDE files, were created in JetBrains IntelliJ 2018.1 IDE.
